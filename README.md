# SOP_New

Cleaning up the old S&OP slides a bit. As requirements were added, I discovered that my code was poorly structured. Other requests got in the way of fixing this problem but I was finally able to clean-up and discover the real benefits of using RMarkdown.

## Changes

* Kept scripts for import and cleaning separate and used RMarkdown with source() fuction to cleanly run both scripts as well as easily troubleshoot any errors 
* Script has been updated to dynamically change dates from backlog each month. No longer am I updating scripts to push the months out. Saves a ton of time and creates fewer errors.

## To Do

I'm working on learning both Shiny and flexdashboard. I think this meeting would be better if the data could be shared as an interactive dashboard that is available at all times as a link on the working group memeber's browser. Additionally, if the dashboard allows the user to create their own views and review the data in several different formats, they'll be more engaged when we have the monthly meetings.

Right now, I'm not sure the Shiny side will be too important. The true value will be in the space savings--the interactivity will allow me to condense the presentation down into fewer pages.
